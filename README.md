# StableGNN
This is a component for autonomous learning of explainable graph neural networks.

### Library Highlights
It consists of three modules:
* Graph: reading input data and learning graph structure
* Model: predicting over graphs and nodes with high extrapolating ability and 
* Explain: explanation of models results

Graph consists of 
* y - labels
* x - attributes
* edge_index 
* num_nodes - number of nodes in your graph
* d - dimension of attributes
